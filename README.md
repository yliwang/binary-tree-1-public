This assignment needs only implement code in leafnode.c, and within the fucntion get_num_leaf, the function, as the name indicates, count the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree, and return it.
The code in defs.h, tree.h, and tree.c should not be modified, all your code for accomplish the task should goes into leafnode.c, of course, you can modify main.c to test your implementation.
Some examples:
for this binary tree (* denotes node), 
*
the function get_num_leaf should return 1.
for the following binary tree, it returns 3
    *
  /   \
  *    *
 and etc.
